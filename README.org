Thin python wrapper around [[https://github.com/dagrejs/dagre-d3][dagre-d3]] for building quick dags with tooltips and a
few other niceties. It's not really generically usable right now, but you can
try something like:

#+begin_src python
  from dagre_py.core import plot

  plot({
      "nodes": [
          {"label": "A"},
          {"label": "B", "description": "This is an output node"}
      ],
      "edges": [{"source": "A", "target": "B"}]
  })
#+end_src

With the following effect:
