Thin python wrapper around [[https://github.com/dagrejs/dagre-d3][dagre-d3]]. It's not really generically usable right
now, but you can try something like:

#+begin_src python
  from dagpy.core import plot

  plot({
      "nodes": [
          {"name": "A", "type": "input"},
          {"name": "B", "type": "output", "description": "This is an output node"}
      ],
      "edges": [("A", "B")]
  })
#+end_src

With the following effect:
