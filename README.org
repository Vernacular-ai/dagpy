Thin python wrapper around [[https://github.com/dagrejs/dagre-d3][dagre-d3]] for building quick dags with tooltips and a
few other niceties. It's not really generically usable right now, but you can
try something like:

#+begin_src python
  from dagre_py.core import plot

  plot({
      "nodes": [
          {"label": "A"},
          {"label": "B", "description": "This is an output node"}
      ],
      "edges": [{"source": "A", "target": "B", "label": "edge1"},
                {"source": "A", "target": "B", "label": "edge2"}]
  })
#+end_src

With the following effect:

It's also possible to use an id field coupled with a label to disambiguate nodes that you want to have the same label.
Where source and target fields in edges use id instead of label.
For example:

#+begin_src python
  from dagre_py.core import plot

  plot({
      "nodes": [
          {"label": "A", "id": "A"},
          {"label": "A", "id": "B", "description": "This is an output node"}
      ],
      "edges": [{"source": "A", "target": "B", "label": "edge1"},
                {"source": "A", "target": "B", "label": "edge2"}]
  })

With the following effect:
